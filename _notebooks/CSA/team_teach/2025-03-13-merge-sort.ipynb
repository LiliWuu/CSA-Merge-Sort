    "- Highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses \"**divide and conquer**\" to sort a list\n",
    "- Repeatedly divides sublists until the list has one element, then merges sublists to a sorted list\n",

    "### Pros\n",
    "1. Efficiency\n",
    "- Time complexity of O(nlogn)\n",
    "    - Time taken to sort data grows slowly as size of data increases, so good for large datasets\n",
    "2. Stability\n",
    "- **Stable sorting algorithm** - preserves the order of elements with equal values during sorting\n",
